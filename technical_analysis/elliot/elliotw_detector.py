# Function to detect Elliott Waves
def detect_elliott_waves(prices):
    """
    Detect Elliott Waves in a given price series.

    Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis approach used to analyze financial market trends and predict future price movements. It is based on the belief that financial markets, such as stocks or cryptocurrencies, move in repetitive patterns or waves. These waves consist of alternating upswings and downswings that can be identified and used to make trading decisions.

    This function identifies potential Elliott Waves based on the pattern of rising and falling prices. It detects impulse waves, which are the main directional waves in the overall trend, as well as corrective waves, which are counter-trend waves that follow the impulse waves.

    Args:
        prices (numpy.ndarray): Array of closing prices.

    Returns:
        list: List of detected Elliott Waves.
